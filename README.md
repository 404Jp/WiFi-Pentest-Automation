# WiFi Pentest Automation

WiFi Pentest Automation is a Python-based tool for setting up a WiFi access point, scanning connected devices, capturing network traffic, and performing vulnerability assessments using Metasploit. This tool is designed for network security professionals and penetration testers to streamline their testing process in a controlled environment.

## Features

- **WiFi Access Point Setup:** Configure and activate a WiFi access point with optional WPA2 encryption.
- **Network Scanning:** Discover devices connected to the WiFi access point using Nmap.
- **Traffic Capture:** Capture network traffic using tcpdump for later analysis.
- **Metasploit Scanning:** Perform vulnerability scans on selected devices using Metasploit.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Kali Linux or any other Linux distribution with `hostapd`, `dnsmasq`, `nmap`, `tcpdump`, and `metasploit-framework` installed
- `sudo` privileges for installing and configuring services

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/404Jp/WiFi-Pentest-Automation.git
    cd WiFi-Pentest-Automation
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    Make sure you have all the necessary packages installed on your system. Use the following commands to install them if needed:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y hostapd dnsmasq nmap tcpdump metasploit-framework
    ```

3. **Configure Scripts:**

    Ensure that the `setup_wifi.py`, `scan_network.py`, `capture_traffic.py`, and `metasploit_scan.py` scripts have the correct permissions and are executable.

## Usage

1. **Run the Main Script:**

    ```bash
    sudo python3 main.py
    ```

2. **Follow the Prompts:**

    - Enter the SSID and optional password for the WiFi access point.
    - Choose a device from the list of connected devices for vulnerability assessment.
    - The tool will automatically configure the access point, scan for devices, capture traffic, and perform a vulnerability scan.
